1. echo creates a file sample_data.txt with sample content.

2. ln creates a hard link pointing to the same inode.

3. ln -s creates a symbolic link pointing to the original file.

4. ls -i displays inode numbers of the files.

5. sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode because hard links reference the same data.

6. ls -l displays file permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps.

7. du -sh shows disk usage of the home directory.

8. ls -lh displays sizes of files in human-readable format.

9. Removing the symbolic link does not affect the original file.

10. du shows directory space usage and df shows filesystem disk usage.
